This view is used to show the members' list and the member's details

Params:

detailsView : 
	if detailsView == false or void string, the details view is hidden
	detailsView should be equals to "read", "create", or "edit" when use it.

members :
	a list contain the members, need to be assigned in list view

member : 
	a variable used to show, edit or creat member, need to be assigned when show or edit

A confusing things in member is it has two id, a Id and a memberId, in url, we use Id, but in views, we show memberId
